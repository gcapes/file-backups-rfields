# Structure of the problem
- List files (recursively) in data directory
- Extract any metadata
- Copy to destination, using directory structure for metadata
- Confirm files have been copied
- Delete files from original location

# Questions
- Is there just one directory (with subdirectories) for each PC?
- Do the time stamp and permissions have to be preserved?
- Will all files be complete, or will any need appending to?
